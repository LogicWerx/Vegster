# Vegster
## A Social Recipe website

Vegster is a social recipe site, and this is the source for it.  It will have the following basic features upon completion:

* Collection of recipes from users
* Ability to follow recipes of others, and be followed
* Ability to 'like/+1' a recipe
* Ability to search for recipes
* Ability to send to Facebook/Twitter description of a recipe

The site will be driven using a 'filter' approach.  As I (creator) am a vegan, I decided on the following:

1. Strict Vegan - return only strict vegan (no honey, etc.) recipes
2. Vegan - return vegan (with honey) and strict vegan
3. Vegetarian - return vegetarian (with dairy) and vegan, and strict vegan
4. Non Vegetarian - returns those which may contain animal products (meat, eggs, dairy) as well as all others.

There will be cuisines, such as (but not limited to):

* Indian
* Thai
* Mexican
* etc.

There will be also a way to identify a category of the recipe, again such as (but not limited to):

* Breakfast
* Lunch
* Supper
* Tea
* Snack
* Soup
* Appetizer
* Desert
* etc.

As time goes on, there will likely be more added to this - and maybe some removed.  We'll be building this in an agile fashion, so it will be prioritized, reworked, and running with iterative builds.  For the short term - I'll be deploying to the free Heroku site, but as it nears a 'prod-like' state, I may ante up and put it somewhere 'real' (as in - a nice domain name: sadly, vegster.org is taken).
